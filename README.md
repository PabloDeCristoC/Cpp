# 📘 C/C++ — EVERYTHING DEVELOPED IN THIS LANGUAGE

This repository is my **personal record** of educational progress and formation.  
It contains notes, code examples, and exercises from my university courses, mainly focused on:  
- **Algorithms and Programming**  
- **Data Structures**  
- **Coming soon**  

All examples are written in `C++` and organized by topic to facilitate clarity and help me track my learning journey.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This repo is *only* a personal log of my study process and programming practice.  
> For full projects, portfolio, and additional materials, visit my website and GitHub profile.
